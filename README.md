# MagickSummarizer

This Json file represent nodes to be used in Magickml, a visual programming interface to deploy Artificial Intelligence agents. This creation is the result of my Bachelor thesis, where I explored the perception and utilization of AI summaries by Business students.

This agent is to be deployed on discord or Slack, and summarizes educational content (Focused on Business Administration content) on a details level between 1-5 depending on the user's request

This agent works by extracting the text from a PDF file, and splitting the text in 1-4 different extracts, which are then summarized and sent back to the user. 

There are also API calls to Exa search to retrieve relevant links on the same topic as the PDF one wants summarized

This code contains 374 different nodes, each performing a specific action
